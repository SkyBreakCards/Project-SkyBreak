        Welcome to the Homepage of SkyBreak Cards
    </h1>
    <p>
        SkyBreak Cards was founded in 2021 in Waltham, Massachussets. The brain child of an economics and finance student from Bentley University. Coupling what he learned in the classroom, he was able to translate that predictive modeling knowledge to the world of baseball cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our hope for SkyBreak Cards is to become a useful and inventive tool that all hobbyists must have in their arsenal.
    </p>
    <p>
        We utilize a propreitary valuation system based on historical statistics, current trends, and future probability to pinpoint the players you should be keeping an eye on for the season.
